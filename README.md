## What is this project?

This project is for the admin pages of my personal website [robbailey3](https://robbailey3.co.uk). It uses the latest Angular framework and works with the PHP REST API which I have created to retrieve data from a MySQL database.

It currently includes a basic To-Do list.

In the future, it will include:

- A blog post management system
- An image gallery management interface
- Multiple themes
- Project manager
- Calendar
- Email client

## Why Angular?

I have chosen to use Angular primarily because it is th technology I am most familiar with.
